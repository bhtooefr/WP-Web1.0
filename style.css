Description: WP Web 1.0 brings your site to the past with simple img tags and no animations whatsoever. With a focus on simple sites, it (will) feature the same stuff any WordPress theme features, maybe. Don't personalize anything, especially not with a custom color scheme, and maybe don't showcase your multimedia content at all. Our not-so-default theme for 1997 works great in many languages, for any abilities, and on any device.
